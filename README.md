sequence of linear_programming program

This is the program for sizing the on-chip power grid networks for electromigration reliability effects using sequence of linear programming.
It was the first program to apply the concept of sequenc of linear programming to solve a constrained nonlinear programming problem in EDA/CADs area.


The program is resulting of the follow papers from my research group:
