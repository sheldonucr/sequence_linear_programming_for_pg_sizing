/*
    Constraint Format in PGOPT system

    We use fixed style. Line begin with '#' are comments.
    The first word of each line are the key word.

    we have following statements:

    LAYER layer_index unit_res min_width max_current_density
    CONST var1 RELATION var2/value
    VAR name resistor_length min_width layer_index

    For CONST type statement. the the left hand side of the expression
    must be varibles. The numerical value can only appear on the right
    hand side.

    variables can consist of
            (1) voltage variable with node in parentheses.
            No spaces allowed in bewteen.
            example: CONST v(1) > 4.99
            (2) branch width variable with branch name in parentheses.
            No spaces allowed in bewteen.
            exmaple:
            CONST w(r2) == w(r14)
            CONST w(r2) >= 0.9n
        RELATION supported in branch width are:
        "==" -- Equal
        ">" or ">=" -- great or great or equal to. There are same
        internally.
