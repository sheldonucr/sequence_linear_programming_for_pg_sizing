Lookup(char str[], char *(table[]))
/* Pointer to a string to be looked up */
/* Pointer to an array of string pointers
 * which are the valid commands.  The strings
 * must be ordered monotonically (i.e. all
 * strings whose first characters are identical
 * must be adjacent in the table).  Each string
 * consists of a command name terminated either
 * by white space or the end of the string.
 */

/*---------------------------------------------------------
 *    Lookup searches a table of strings to find one that matches a
 *    given string.
 *
 *    Results:
 *    If str is an unambiguous abbreviation for one of the entries
 *    in table, then the index of the matching entry is returned.
 *    If str is an abbreviation for more than one entry in table,
 *    then -1 is returned.  If str doesn't match any entry, then
 *    -2 is returned.
 *
 *    Side Effects:    None.

     * through table from its end.  The two pointers mark the range of
     * strings that match the portion of str that we have scanned.  When
     * all of the characters of str have been scanned, then the two
     * pointers better be identical.
