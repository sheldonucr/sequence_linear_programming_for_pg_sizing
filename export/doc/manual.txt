PGOPT V1.4 Sheldon X.-D. Tan

PGOPT is a computer program for sizing wire widths of power/ground
networks of VLSI layouts subject to electromigration constraints and
design rule constraints.



USAGE:
		pgopt {spice_like_netlist.sp}

INPUT/OUTPUT FILES:

		The spice-like netlist has suffix ".sp".  The spice-like
		netlist file contains the power/ground netlist which is
		similar to the spice input deck in terms of format.  The
		difference is that each line containing a resistor also have
		the width and length and layer index information of the
		resistive wire segment.  The independent voltage and current
		sources are same as that in spice.

		In addition to the netlist, there is constraint file with
		".BS" as the suffix. When ".sp" file is loaded into pgopt, the
		".cs" will be loaded automatically (pgopt will look for it at
		current directory).  The ".cs" file has the technology related
		information and constraints. Each line begins with a key
		word. Each key word is explained in the following:

		LAYER layer_index, unit_res, min_width, max_current_density
		For instance: LAYER 37 0.1 0.4 1.7

		CONST constraint

		for instance:
		CONST v(3) <= 4.0 -- voltage at node 3 should be less than 4.0
		CONST w(r2) == w(r4) -- widths of r2 and r4 should be identical.

		PGOPT will generate the same spice-like output file for the sized
		the power/ground network.

SYNOPSIS:

		PGOPT has a simple command shell. When PGOPT is invoked, you
		will be prompted with semicolon ":". There are a number of
		commands available for this version. You can type the whole
		command include the space or portion of the command as long as
		that portion distinguishes it from other commands.

		help: give a summary of all the available commands and their
		usages.

		dc analysis: perform the dc analysis on the given P/G network
		to obtain the initial solution.

		sensitivity analysis: perform the sensitivity analysis for
		each circuit element for each circuit node voltage by using
		adjoint method.
		
		load [file]: load the command file which is a plain text file
		consisting of commands available for PGOPT. (like help, dc
		analysis).

		source [file]: load the spice-like netlist ".sp" file in case
		the file is not provided in the command line. For convenience,
		the ".cs" (with the same base name) is also loaded.

		const [file]: load the constraint ".cs" file. Unless the ".sp"
		and ".cs" use different base names, this command should not be
		used.

		opt {conjugate(default), slp}: perform the wire sizing
		optimization.  There are two options for the commands,
		"conjugate" means using conjugate gradient algorithm, while
		"slp" means using sequence of linear programming. The default
		option is conjugate gradient. "opt" command will
		automatically perform dc analysis, sensitivity analysis (if
		using conjugate gradient method).  After loading the netlist
		and constraint file, opt command will take care of all the
		optimization steps.

		lp_solve [file]: output the file consisting of objective and
		constraints which are suitable for input of lp_solve, the 
		linear programming solver.

		output_netlist [file]: write out the sized spice-like output
		file.

		stat: print out the node voltages and branch currents and
		width of each wire segment on the stdin. Be careful when a
		large circuit is loaded.

		process [physical_netlist]: read in a avant! style physical
		layout netlist. (do not use it).

		resf [restrication_factor]: set up a new the restriction
		factor (the default value is 0.8). The factor is used in the
		sequence of linear programming for convergence control.


ENVIRONMENT:

		In addition to PGOPT, linear programming solver, lp_solve,
		should also be available (in the search path) if sequence of
		linear programming is used.
