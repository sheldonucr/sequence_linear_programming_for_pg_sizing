PGOPT V1.5, 
(c) 1999-2003, Sheldon X.-D. Tan

The directory contains all the files of the released PGOPT V1.4,
a power/ground network optimization program.

This directory consists of three sub-directories:

bin: all the executable binary files.

	 pgopt is the main PGOPT program.
	 lp_solve is the linear programming solver.

demo: sample power/ground netlist and constraint files.

	  There are two demo batch files, demo1 and demo2.
	  You can just type demo1 or demo2 in the unix shell
	  to launch a small demo on optimization of pg4x4.sp
	  network circuit. demo1 uses sequence of linear programming
      method, demo2 uses conjugate gradient method.


doc: one manual file, manual.txt.

Please refer to the manual.txt for the detailed usage of this program.
